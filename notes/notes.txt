## notes:

what is ansible?: configuring ec2s that have already been provisioned..
what is awk?: splits by whitespace by default, columns can be accessed by $X..

docker:
- `alpine:latest` refers to the latest version of the Alpine Linux Docker image available on Docker Hub.

git:
- github: add ".patch" in front of githubs commit url for detailed info..

systemd:
- It is the first userspace process the kernel starts..
- Every service, timer, socket, mount, etc. is a "unit" tracked by systemd..

terraform:
- provisions infrastructure..
- terraform init
- terraform apply

ssh:
- you can add stuff to ~/.ssh/config for quick commands like so:

Host cloud-devbox
  HostName ec2-xxx.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ang-aws.pem

Host fast
  HostName ec2-xxx.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ang-ap.pem

IAM:
- ec2 dashboard
- go to instance
- actions > security > modify iam role
- create role with AmazonEC2FullAccess
- check iam role from within your ec2: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info` (IMDSv2 requires token)

EC2:
- AMI-IDs are different across regions..
